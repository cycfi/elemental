= Stretch

include::../common.adoc[]

== Overview

Resizable elements are elements with _minimum limits_ that are less than the
_maximum limits_ in either x or y dimensions or both. Resizable elements can
therefore stretch if there is extra available space allocated to it beyond
its minimum limit. When two or more resizable elements are placed side by
side in an <<htile,htile>> or <<vtile,vtile>>, the element's "stretchiness"
determines how much extra space is given to it. The element's "stretchiness"
is determined by the element's `stretch` member function:

[source,c++]
----
virtual view_stretch stretch() const;
----

where `view_stretch` is a struct declared as:

[source,c++]
----
struct view_stretch
{
   float    x = 1.0;
   float    y = 1.0;
};
----

The `view_stretch` `x` and `y` members determine how much an element can
stretch in the x or y dimensions. The default is 1.0. A stretchiness value of
2.0 means that the element is able to stretch twice as much compared to its
siblings in an <<htile,htile>> or <<vtile,vtile>>, assuming they have the
default 1.0 stretchiness.

== hstretch

image::/layout/hstretch.svg[alt="hstretch", width=232px, role=center]

Overrides the horizontal stretchiness of an an enclosed element (`subject`).

=== Notation

`stretch`:: A scalar value
`subject`:: Instance of `Element`

=== Expressions

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Expression | Semantics

a|
[source,c++]
----
hstretch(stretch, subject)
----
a|
* The `subject` will assume the given `stretch` value.
* The stretch value has no effect on elements with fixed horizontal size.
* Returns instance of `Proxy`.
|===

For example, the image below shows how three elements are laid out in an
`htile`, with stretch values of `1.0`, `1.0` and `2.0`, respectively:

image::/layout/htile-stretch.svg[alt="htile-stretch", width=232px, role=center]

The element with the `2.0` stretch value stretches twice as much compared to
its siblings.

== vstretch

image::/layout/vstretch.svg[alt="vstretch", width=316px, role=center]

Overrides the vertical stretchiness of an an enclosed element (`subject`).

=== Notation

`stretch`:: A scalar value
`subject`:: Instance of `Element`

=== Expressions

[cols="2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Expression | Semantics

a|
[source,c++]
----
vstretch(stretch, subject)
----
a|
* The `subject` will assume the given `stretch` value.
* The stretch value has no effect on elements with fixed _vertical limits_.
* Returns instance of `Proxy`.
|===

For example, the image below shows how three elements are laid out in an
`htile`, with stretch values of `0.5`, `1.0` and `1.5`, respectively:

image::/layout/vtile-stretch.svg[alt="vtile-stretch", width=232px, role=center]

The element with the `0.5` stretch value stretches half less, while the
element with the `1.5` stretches half more than the default.
