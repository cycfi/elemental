== Overview

The Elements Library provides a comprehensive set of elements for laying out
elements in the view, including tiles, grids, flow layouts, floating
elements, layers, alignment elements, scale elements, and span elements.

* Tiles arrange elements in rows or columns, positioning them one after the
other based on the child element's sizing limits.
* Grids offer a structured layout with rows and columns, using normalized
coordinate placements.
* The flow element arranges its children left to right, fitting as many as
possible within each row, and moves to the next row once full.
* Floating elements allow for arbitrary positioning within containers.
* Layers enable elements to be stacked on top of each other.

The document also details the use of margins and sizing elements to provide
proper spacing and ensure elements fit within the layout.

* Alignment elements ensure correct positioning.
* Scale elements adjust size proportionally.
* Span elements extend across multiple grid cells.

By combining these various layout elements, developers can create versatile,
responsive, and visually consistent user interfaces that adapt seamlessly
across different devices and screen sizes.
