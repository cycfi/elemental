key design aspects of the Elements C++ GUI library are: Modular: Elements is very lightweight and extremely modular, facilitating the composition of fine-grained, flyweight, and reusable ``elements'' into complex element hierarchies. This is achieved through a declarative interface with heavy emphasis on reuse, allowing developers to build sophisticated GUI structures efficiently. Declarative: Elements exposes a declarative API using modern C++. Declarative C++ code tells you what rather than how (contrasting with imperative programming which involves control flow). There are no code generators. The GUI is declared entirely in C++ code. After a while, code reuse, using a palette of fine-grained elements, becomes very familiar and intuitive, much like using HTML. Interoperable: Elements is usable in any application and plays well with other GUI libraries and frameworks. The library is loosely coupled with the application and windowing system and can co-exist with components within a host. It should be easy to integrate Elements with any existing application. This document will demonstrate the modular and declarative design aspects of the Elements library through examples. Specific examples should make it clear. Let’s start with a basic window with a dark grey background. The examples presented here can be found in this link: https://github.com/cycfi/elements/tree/master/examples/doc_aspects #include using namespace cycfi::elements; // Main window background color auto constexpr bkd_color = rgba(35, 35, 37, 255); auto background = box(bkd_color); int main(int argc, const char* argv[]) { app _app(argc, argv); window _win(_app.name()); _win.on_close = [&_app]() {_app.stop();}; view view_(_win); view_.content( background ); _app.run(); return 0; } Here, we create an app and a window, and set the window’s on_close to stop (quit) the application. _win.on_close is called when the window is closed by the user, thereby quitting the application. Like any other GUI library or framework, the app manages the main event loop, while the window manages application windows. However, take note that the app and the window classes are optional. There are certain situations, like e.g. building plugins or incorporating Elements in another framework such as QT, where you do not want Elements to manage the event loop or windows. The important class of interest here is the view. In these cases, you want to embed the view directly. You can directly construct a view given a platform window (or widget), as its main content view or child window (or widget). The view does not know anything about drawing or user interaction. Instead, it relies on its client supplied content to do these. Without any content, it is an empty shell. And so this is where it starts to get interesting. The content of the view typically contains multiple layers, much like typical graphics applications. In this example, we only have one layer: the background. auto background = box(bkd_color); It is a simple, infinitely resizable box with the specified color: rgba(35, 35, 37, 255). It will resize automatically when the window is resized. We set it as the view’s content: view_.content( background ); Running this example, you get: Now let’s add a blue round rectangle. We’ve seen how to create a box: the background using box, passing in a color. A rounded box is created using rbox, passing in the color and the corner radius: auto blue_rbox = rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10); The color, this time, is specified by name from the colors namespace. The namespace includes all predefined colors from the standard HTML Color Names. We can actually use blue_rbox already, as-is, by placing it in another layer in the view: view_.content( blue_rbox, background ); But like the box, the rbox is infinitely resizable and will hog the entire window. What we want is to give it a specific size and center it in the window. Elements are very lightweight. Most elements do not even have a size, nor know their position in the view (elements without position information are inherently relocatable —they can be placed anywhere; the position is supplied at rendering time). So we give it a 100x50 size by wrapping it in the fixed_size element: auto blue_rbox = fixed_size( {100, 50}, rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) ); And then we align it centered (in the x axis) and middle (in the Y axis) using the align_center_middle element: auto blue_rbox = align_center_middle( fixed_size( {100, 50}, rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) ) ); Without the alignment element, the main window would have been constrained to a fixed 100x50 size. There’s a multitude of alignment elements available. See Layout. So now, we are seeing how fine-grained elements are composed. The rbox is placed inside the fixed_size element which is then placed inside a align_center_middle element. Let’s run this example: Our goal this time is to place some text inside the blue box. The element we will use is the label. Most elements do not have a size, but as an exception, labels (simple text elements) do. So, instead of fixing the size of the box using fixed_size, we place the label alongside the box in a layer element, but add some margin around the label. Here’s how you do it: auto blue_rbox = align_center_middle( layer( margin( {25, 20, 25, 18}, label(\"“Dogs are my favorite people”\") ), rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) ) ); If it’s not obvious yet, let’s take it apart into its constituent pieces: Step 1: We make a label: label(\"“Dogs are my favorite people”\") Step 2: We add margin around it: margin( {25, 20, 25, 18}, label(\"“Dogs are my favorite people”\") ) Note that like the align elements, there’s a multitude of margins such as left_margin, right_margin, etc. Step 3: We make a blue rounded box: rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) Step 4: We place the label and the blue rounded box as siblings in a layer element: layer( margin( {25, 20, 25, 18}, label(\"“Dogs are my favorite people”\") ), rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) ) Step 4: Then finally, we place it in the align_center_middle element. If the element hierarchy gets a bit too deep, use the C++ auto to name sub-parts of the element composition to make it easier to understand. The layer element is a composite element that holds zero or more child elements. Some of you might have noticed that we already mentioned the layer element before when we were discussing the view’s content in the App and Window section: `The content of the `view typically contains multiple layers, much like typical graphics applications''. Well, actually, this is the same layer thing here. The view’s main content is a layer element. So now we have: To demonstrate the fine-grained and modular nature of Elements, it is perhaps illustrative to say that many components in Elements, including the slider element, are not atomic and are actually composed of smaller parts. In this section, we will see how one creates a slider from the basic parts that we have dealt with in the previous sections. Take note that this example is only for illustrative purposes. The library provides easier ways to make sliders. Elements has a collection of pre-made, reusable element compositions, just like what we do here, but more refined. That collection is constantly growing. Composing elements is fun! The slider has two parts: the track and the thumb. Here, we make a simple track using the same old box. We made it black. Then, we reused the same \"Dogs are my favorite people\" label for the thumb. The result looks silly, I should say, but hey, we are trying to make a point! auto track = hsize(10, box(colors::black)); auto thumb = layer( margin( {25, 20, 25, 18}, label(\"“Dogs are my favorite people”\") ), rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) ); auto funny_slider = slider(thumb, track); And here it is in action: Now, like before, we add our funny slider to our view: view_.content( align_center(funny_slider), background ); But note that, in this case, we want to center the slider only horizontally, so we use align_center instead of align_center_middle. Ok, there you go! Now go and be creative and make your own controls! Here’s the complete prgram: #include using namespace cycfi::elements; using cycfi::artist::rgba; namespace colors = cycfi::artist::colors; // Main window background color auto constexpr bkd_color = rgba(35, 35, 37, 255); auto background = box(bkd_color); auto track = hsize(10, box(colors::black)); auto thumb = layer( margin( {25, 20, 25, 18}, label(\"“Dogs are my favorite people”\") ), margin( {5, 5, 5, 5}, rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) ) ); auto funny_slider = slider(thumb, track); int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { app _app(\"Aspects\"); window _win(_app.name()); _win.on_close = [&_app]() { _app.stop(); }; view view_(_win); view_.content( align_center(funny_slider), background ); _app.run(); return 0; } Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Joel de Guzman.

The library is written using modern C++17 language features. It has a declarative interface with a sensible and easy-to-use Domain Specific Embedded Languages (DSEL) syntax for constructing the GUI elements. A declarative description of the GUI is written exclusively in C++, and therefore, there is no need for an external visual GUI editor or code generator. Elements is embeddable, meaning you can embed it in any application, and it will play well with other GUI libraries and frameworks. This also implies that you can utilize it for the creation of plugins. It does not own the event loop and is able to co-exist with components within a plugin host, such as VST and AU. Porting to a new host target is straightforward, requiring the porting of only a few files. Elements is distributed under the liberal and non-viral MIT License.

Tiles arrange elements in rows or columns, positioning them one after the other based on the child element’s sizing limits. Grids offer a structured layout with rows and columns, using normalized coordinate placements. The flow element arranges its children left to right, fitting as many as possible within each row, and moves to the next row once full. Floating elements allow for arbitrary positioning within containers. Layers enable elements to be stacked on top of each other. The document also details the use of margins and sizing elements to provide proper spacing and ensure elements fit within the layout. Alignment elements ensure correct positioning. Scale elements adjust size proportionally. Span elements extend across multiple grid cells. By combining these various layout elements, developers can create versatile, responsive, and visually consistent user interfaces that adapt seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

In the Mac, we support the XCode IDE. In Windows, we support Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2022, although it will probably also work with older versions of the Visual Studio IDE. In Linux, we support both Clang and g++. Get the latest version with a C++20 compiler. The CLion IDE is supported on all platforms, it simply requires the CMakeLists.txt file to open and build the project. Elements C++ GUI library, plus the Cycfi Infra library: git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cycfi/elements.git Make sure you have CMake 3.15 or higher. Follow the installation procedure for your platform, or follow the instructions below for specific environments. Here are Element’s dependencies: pkg-config Cairo fontconfig freetype2 bzip2 expat zlib libpng libwebp Specific instructions are provided below for specific environments. Additionally, the following libraries are dragged as submodules: The Cycfi infra library Infra provides some basic groundwork common to Cycfi libraries, including Elements. Using Homebrew: brew install pkg-config brew install cairo brew install fontconfig brew install bzip2 brew install expat brew install zlib brew install libpng brew install webp brew install cmake There are multiple ways to generate a project file using CMake depending on your platform and desired IDE, but here is an example for the MacOS: CD to the elements library. Make a build directory inside the elements directory. CD to the build directory. invoke cmake. cd elements mkdir build cd build cmake -GXcode ../ If you are having issues with code signing, disable it by setting the CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED variable to NO: cmake -GXcode -DCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO ../ If successful, CMake will generate an XCode project in the build directory. Open the project file elements.xcodeproj and build all. You should see a couple of example applications. If you are having problems with code signing, do this: Build Settings→Code Signing Identity for ALL_BUILD and elements, click, then choose \"Other\", then clear the text (empty). Do this for both ALL_BUILD and elements. The Windows port requires a package manager that supports the dependencies listed above. One popular package manager is vcpkg. We will use vcpkg in the setup instructions below. Clone and bootstrap the vcpkg dependency manager. I suggest placing it in c:\\ or c:\\Program Files, but it does not really matter where. git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg .\\vcpkg\\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat Install the dependencies: vcpkg install pkgconf vcpkg install cairo vcpkg install libwebp Installing Cairo already brings in the other dependencies. Follow the installation procedure. If you have Visual Studio 2022: Use the Visual Studio GUI for a graphical development environment. Use NMake for make-style command-line builds. CD to the elements library. Make a build directory inside the elements directory. CD to the build directory. invoke cmake. cd elements mkdir build cd build You will need to tell cmake the location of the vcpkg toolchain file. That way, find_package will know where to find the installed libraries. If you installed vcpkg in c:\\ as suggested, you invoke cmake like this: cmake -G\"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=c:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ../ If successful, cmake will generate a Visual Studio solution in the build directory. Open the project file elements.sln and build all. You should see a couple of example applications. Open a Command Prompt for VS 2022 ({x64/x86-64} {Native/Cross} Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019) in your start menu. CD to the elements library. Make a build directory inside the elements directory. CD to the build directory. invoke cmake. cd elements mkdir build cd build Again, you will need to tell cmake the location of the vcpkg toolchain file. If you installed vcpkg in c:\\ as suggested, you invoke cmake like this: cmake -G\"NMake Makefiles\" -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=c:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ../ If successful, cmake will generate NMake Make files in the build directory. Invoke nmake to build the binary. MSYS2 is a software distro and building platform for Windows Download MSYS2 from its official website and install it. Its installation guide is on the home page. Open MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit or MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit from your start menu. Install tools and libraries: pacman -S ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-toolchain pacman -S ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-cairo pacman -S ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-gtk3 pacman -S ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-libwebp pacman -S make pacman -S ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-cmake There are multiple ways to generate a project file using CMake depending on your platform and desired IDE, but here is an example for MSYS2: CD to the elements library. Make a build directory inside the elements directory. CD to the build directory. invoke cmake. -DELEMENTS_HOST_UI_LIBRARY=gtk tells cmake to build with Gtk. cd elements mkdir build cd build cmake ../ -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DELEMENTS_HOST_UI_LIBRARY=gtk If successful, cmake will generate Unix Make files in the build directory. In addition to the requirements listed in the requirements section, the GTK3 library is also required by the Linux port of Elements. On Debian and derived distributions using apt-get (requires sudo): sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev sudo apt-get install libwebp-dev sudo apt-get -y install cmake There are multiple ways to generate a project file using CMake depending on your platform and desired IDE, but here is an example for Linux: CD to the elements library. Make a build directory inside the elements directory. CD to the build directory. invoke cmake. cd elements mkdir build cd build cmake -G \"Unix Makefiles\" ../ If successful, cmake will generate Unix Make files in the build directory. If successful, cmake will generate a project file or makefiles in the build directory. Build the library and example programs using the generated makefiles or open the project file using your IDE and build all. You should see a couple of example applications in there that you can run. These examples are provided as starting points to get you up to speed in learning how to use the library. For simplicity, each example is contained in a single main.cpp source file. Feel free to inspect and mess with the examples. Each example demonstrates different aspects of the Elements library, from layout to control. You’d probably want to start with the “hello_universe” example, which is the Element’s hello-world counterpart. You can copy the “empty” example and use it as a boilerplate for your own project. See next section on how to copy an example and build outside the Elements project directory. Tips: Resize the window and see the elements fluidly resize Use two-finger swipe to move the sliders and knobs The Elements project is set up so that you can easily copy and paste any of the examples outside the project, set -DELEMENTS_ROOT=\"path/to/elements\", and the example should immediately build without any hassle. Here’s an example for XCode assuming the elements lib is in the same directory alongside the \"hello_universe\" example directory you copied to: Copy the hello_universe example project directory. Make a build directory inside the hello_universe directory. CD to the build directory. cmake -GXcode -DELEMENTS_ROOT=\"../elements\" ../ Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Joel de Guzman. All rights reserved.

Both tiles and grids allow elements to fluidly adjust depending on available space. Grids lay out its elements using externally supplied normalized fractional coordinates that specify positions of the elements in the allocated space. Grids are best for composing tables. Horizontal Grids are composites that lay out one or more child elements in a row following externally supplied horizontal fractional positions. Horizontal Grids have computed horizontal and vertical sizes following the natural limits of its children. The elements are laid out in a single row, left to right, immediately next to each other with no intervening space. The elements are positioned horizontally using the supplied fractional positions. The fractional positions values range from 0.0 to 1.0, which specify the child element’s horizontal position from left (0.0) to right (1.0). The grid’s minimum vertical limit is computed as the maximum of the children elements' minimum vertical limits. The grid’s maximum vertical limit is computed as the minimum of the children elements' maximum vertical limits. The final computed minimum limit is clamped to ensure it is not greater than the computed maximum limit. Likewise the computed maximum limit is clamped to ensure it is not less than the computed minimum limit. The supplied (horizontal) positions and computed (vertical) coordinates may violate the limits of its children elements. If the allocated size of a child element is lower than the element’s minimum limits in either dimension, the element will be cropped.

The element’s \"stretchiness\" is determined by the element’s stretch member function: virtual view_stretch stretch() const; where view_stretch is a struct declared as: struct view_stretch { float x = 1.0; float y = 1.0; }; The view_stretch x and y members determine how much an element can stretch in the x or y dimensions. The default is 1.0. A stretchiness value of 2.0 means that the element is able to stretch twice as much compared to its siblings in an htile or vtile, assuming they have the default 1.0 stretchiness. Overrides the horizontal stretchiness of an an enclosed element (subject). stretch A scalar value subject Instance of Element hstretch(stretch, subject) The subject will assume the given stretch value. The stretch value has no effect to elements with fixed horizontal size. Returns instance of Proxy. For example, the image below shows how three elements are laid out in an htile, with stretch values of 1.0, 1.0 and 2.0, respectively: The element with the 2.0 stretch value stretches twice as much compared to its siblings. Overrides the vertical stretchiness of an an enclosed element (subject). stretch A scalar value subject Instance of Element vstretch(stretch, subject) The subject will assume the given stretch value. The stretch value has no effect to elements with fixed vertical limits. Returns instance of Proxy. For example, the image below shows how three elements are laid out in an htile, with stretch values of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5, respectively: The element with the 0.5 stretch value stretches half less, while the element with the 1.5 stretches half more than the default.

This is achieved through a declarative interface with heavy emphasis on reuse, allowing developers to build sophisticated GUI structures efficiently. Declarative: Elements exposes a declarative API using modern C++. Declarative C++ code tells you what rather than how (contrasting with imperative programming which involves control flow). There are no code generators. The GUI is declared entirely in C++ code. After a while, code reuse, using a palette of fine-grained elements, becomes very familiar and intuitive, much like using HTML. Interoperable: Elements is usable in any application and plays well with other GUI libraries and frameworks. The library is loosely coupled with the application and windowing system and can co-exist with components within a host. It should be easy to integrate Elements with any existing application. This document will demonstrate the modular and declarative design aspects of the Elements library through examples. Specific examples should make it clear. Let’s start with a basic window with a dark grey background. The examples presented here can be found in this link: https://github.com/cycfi/elements/tree/master/examples/doc_aspects #include using namespace cycfi::elements; // Main window background color auto constexpr bkd_color = rgba(35, 35, 37, 255); auto background = box(bkd_color); int main(int argc, const char* argv[]) { app _app(argc, argv); window _win(_app.name()); _win.on_close = [&_app]() {_app.stop();}; view view_(_win); view_.content( background ); _app.run(); return 0; } Here, we create an app and a window, and set the window’s on_close to stop (quit) the application. _win.on_close is called when the window is closed by the user, thereby quitting the application. Like any other GUI library or framework, the app manages the main event loop, while the window manages application windows. However, take note that the app and the window classes are optional. There are certain situations, like e.g. building plugins or incorporating Elements in another framework such as QT, where you do not want Elements to manage the event loop or windows. The important class of interest here is the view. In these cases, you want to embed the view directly. You can directly construct a view given a platform window (or widget), as its main content view or child window (or widget). The view does not know anything about drawing or user interaction. Instead, it relies on its client supplied content to do these. Without any content, it is an empty shell. And so this is where it starts to get interesting. The content of the view typically contains multiple layers, much like typical graphics applications. In this example, we only have one layer: the background. auto background = box(bkd_color); It is a simple, infinitely resizable box with the specified color: rgba(35, 35, 37, 255). It will resize automatically when the window is resized. We set it as the view’s content: view_.content( background ); Running this example, you get: Now let’s add a blue round rectangle. We’ve seen how to create a box: the background using box, passing in a color. A rounded box is created using rbox, passing in the color and the corner radius: auto blue_rbox = rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10); The color, this time, is specified by name from the colors namespace. The namespace includes all predefined colors from the standard HTML Color Names. We can actually use blue_rbox already, as-is, by placing it in another layer in the view: view_.content( blue_rbox, background ); But like the box, the rbox is infinitely resizable and will hog the entire window. What we want is to give it a specific size and center it in the window. Elements are very lightweight. Most elements do not even have a size, nor know their position in the view (elements without position information are inherently relocatable —they can be placed anywhere; the position is supplied at rendering time). So we give it a 100x50 size by wrapping it in the fixed_size element: auto blue_rbox = fixed_size( {100, 50}, rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) ); And then we align it centered (in the x axis) and middle (in the Y axis) using the align_center_middle element: auto blue_rbox = align_center_middle( fixed_size( {100, 50}, rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) ) ); Without the alignment element, the main window would have been constrained to a fixed 100x50 size. There’s a multitude of alignment elements available. See Layout. So now, we are seeing how fine-grained elements are composed. The rbox is placed inside the fixed_size element which is then placed inside a align_center_middle element. Let’s run this example: Our goal this time is to place some text inside the blue box. The element we will use is the label. Most elements do not have a size, but as an exception, labels (simple text elements) do. So, instead of fixing the size of the box using fixed_size, we place the label alongside the box in a layer element, but add some margin around the label. Here’s how you do it: auto blue_rbox = align_center_middle( layer( margin( {25, 20, 25, 18}, label(\"“Dogs are my favorite people”\") ), rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) ) ); If it’s not obvious yet, let’s take it apart into its constituent pieces: Step 1: We make a label: label(\"“Dogs are my favorite people”\") Step 2: We add margin around it: margin( {25, 20, 25, 18}, label(\"“Dogs are my favorite people”\") ) Note that like the align elements, there’s a multitude of margins such as left_margin, right_margin, etc. Step 3: We make a blue rounded box: rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) Step 4: We place the label and the blue rounded box as siblings in a layer element: layer( margin( {25, 20, 25, 18}, label(\"“Dogs are my favorite people”\") ), rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) ) Step 4: Then finally, we place it in the align_center_middle element. If the element hierarchy gets a bit too deep, use the C++ auto to name sub-parts of the element composition to make it easier to understand. The layer element is a composite element that holds zero or more child elements. Some of you might have noticed that we already mentioned the layer element before when we were discussing the view’s content in the App and Window section: `The content of the `view typically contains multiple layers, much like typical graphics applications''. Well, actually, this is the same layer thing here. The view’s main content is a layer element. So now we have: To demonstrate the fine-grained and modular nature of Elements, it is perhaps illustrative to say that many components in Elements, including the slider element, are not atomic and are actually composed of smaller parts. In this section, we will see how one creates a slider from the basic parts that we have dealt with in the previous sections. Take note that this example is only for illustrative purposes. The library provides easier ways to make sliders. Elements has a collection of pre-made, reusable element compositions, just like what we do here, but more refined. That collection is constantly growing. Composing elements is fun! The slider has two parts: the track and the thumb. Here, we make a simple track using the same old box. We made it black. Then, we reused the same \"Dogs are my favorite people\" label for the thumb. The result looks silly, I should say, but hey, we are trying to make a point! auto track = hsize(10, box(colors::black)); auto thumb = layer( margin( {25, 20, 25, 18}, label(\"“Dogs are my favorite people”\") ), rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) ); auto funny_slider = slider(thumb, track); And here it is in action: Now, like before, we add our funny slider to our view: view_.content( align_center(funny_slider), background ); But note that, in this case, we want to center the slider only horizontally, so we use align_center instead of align_center_middle. Ok, there you go! Now go and be creative and make your own controls! Here’s the complete prgram: #include using namespace cycfi::elements; using cycfi::artist::rgba; namespace colors = cycfi::artist::colors; // Main window background color auto constexpr bkd_color = rgba(35, 35, 37, 255); auto background = box(bkd_color); auto track = hsize(10, box(colors::black)); auto thumb = layer( margin( {25, 20, 25, 18}, label(\"“Dogs are my favorite people”\") ), margin( {5, 5, 5, 5}, rbox(colors::medium_blue, 10) ) ); auto funny_slider = slider(thumb, track); int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { app _app(\"Aspects\"); window _win(_app.name()); _win.on_close = [&_app]() { _app.stop(); }; view view_(_win); view_.content( align_center(funny_slider), background ); _app.run(); return 0; } Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Joel de Guzman.

This document provides an overview of the various elements available. This section will focus on how elements are used, instead of how they are implemented. We will deal with the latter in the Customization section. It suffices to say that elements are implemented as a hierarchy of classes, with the element class at the root. The element class provides the interface for all elements. The element class is a polymorphic class with virtual functions for rendering, layout, and event handling. The Elements Library uses a couple of simple concepts to constrain the types of elements that can be used with templates and template functions. The Element concept constrains the type of a class that derives from the element class, while the ElementPtr concept constrains the type of a pointer to an element. namespace concepts { template concept Element = std::is_base_of_v>; template concept ElementPtr = requires(T p) { { *p } -> std::convertible_to; }; } Most elements are held by value, but they can also be held by shared pointers. Elements held by shared pointers are necessary when elements are placed inside homogeneously typed containers such as std::vector. The library provides a share function for converting an element to a shared pointer. A similar facility is provided for converting a shared pointer to a weak pointer. There are a couple of type aliases that are useful when dealing with shared pointers: using element_ptr = std::shared_ptr; using element_const_ptr = std::shared_ptr; using weak_element_ptr = std::weak_ptr; using weak_element_const_ptr = std::weak_ptr; e Instance of type element ep Instance of type std::shared_ptr, where E is a type that conforms to the Element concept. share(e) (1) get(ep) (2) 1 Returns a shared pointer from element e. The element is copied, or moved, into the shared pointer. 2 Returns a weak pointer from the shared pointer to an element, ep. Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Joel de Guzman. All rights reserved.

A declarative description of the GUI is written exclusively in C++, and therefore, there is no need for an external visual GUI editor or code generator. Elements is embeddable, meaning you can embed it in any application, and it will play well with other GUI libraries and frameworks. This also implies that you can utilize it for the creation of plugins. It does not own the event loop and is able to co-exist with components within a plugin host, such as VST and AU.

Tiles arrange elements in rows or columns, positioning them one after the other based on the child element’s sizing limits. Grids offer a structured layout with rows and columns, using normalized coordinate placements. The flow element arranges its children left to right, fitting as many as possible within each row, and moves to the next row once full. Floating elements allow for arbitrary positioning within containers. Layers enable elements to be stacked on top of each other. The document also details the use of margins and sizing elements to provide proper spacing and ensure elements fit within the layout. Alignment elements ensure correct positioning. Scale elements adjust size proportionally. Span elements extend across multiple grid cells.

In Linux, we support both Clang and g++. Get the latest version with a C++20 compiler. The CLion IDE is supported on all platforms, it simply requires the CMakeLists.txt file to open and build the project. Elements C++ GUI library, plus the Cycfi Infra library: git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/cycfi/elements.git Make sure you have CMake 3.15 or higher. Follow the installation procedure for your platform, or follow the instructions below for specific environments. Here are Element’s dependencies: pkg-config Cairo fontconfig freetype2 bzip2 expat zlib libpng libwebp Specific instructions are provided below for specific environments. Additionally, the following libraries are dragged as submodules: The Cycfi infra library Infra provides some basic groundwork common to Cycfi libraries, including Elements. Using Homebrew: brew install pkg-config brew install cairo brew install fontconfig brew install bzip2 brew install expat brew install zlib brew install libpng brew install webp brew install cmake There are multiple ways to generate a project file using CMake depending on your platform and desired IDE, but here is an example for the MacOS: CD to the elements library. Make a build directory inside the elements directory. CD to the build directory. invoke cmake. cd elements mkdir build cd build cmake -GXcode ../ If you are having issues with code signing, disable it by setting the CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED variable to NO: cmake -GXcode -DCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO ../ If successful, CMake will generate an XCode project in the build directory. Open the project file elements.xcodeproj and build all. You should see a couple of example applications. If you are having problems with code signing, do this: Build Settings→Code Signing Identity for ALL_BUILD and elements, click, then choose \"Other\", then clear the text (empty). Do this for both ALL_BUILD and elements. The Windows port requires a package manager that supports the dependencies listed above. One popular package manager is vcpkg. We will use vcpkg in the setup instructions below. Clone and bootstrap the vcpkg dependency manager. I suggest placing it in c:\\ or c:\\Program Files, but it does not really matter where. git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg .\\vcpkg\\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat Install the dependencies: vcpkg install pkgconf vcpkg install cairo vcpkg install libwebp Installing Cairo already brings in the other dependencies. Follow the installation procedure. If you have Visual Studio 2022: Use the Visual Studio GUI for a graphical development environment. Use NMake for make-style command-line builds. CD to the elements library. Make a build directory inside the elements directory. CD to the build directory. invoke cmake. cd elements mkdir build cd build You will need to tell cmake the location of the vcpkg toolchain file. That way, find_package will know where to find the installed libraries. If you installed vcpkg in c:\\ as suggested, you invoke cmake like this: cmake -G\"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=c:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ../ If successful, cmake will generate a Visual Studio solution in the build directory. Open the project file elements.sln and build all. You should see a couple of example applications.

CD to the build directory. invoke cmake. -DELEMENTS_HOST_UI_LIBRARY=gtk tells cmake to build with Gtk. cd elements mkdir build cd build cmake ../ -G \"Unix Makefiles\" -DELEMENTS_HOST_UI_LIBRARY=gtk If successful, cmake will generate Unix Make files in the build directory. In addition to the requirements listed in the requirements section, the GTK3 library is also required by the Linux port of Elements. On Debian and derived distributions using apt-get (requires sudo): sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev sudo apt-get install libwebp-dev sudo apt-get -y install cmake There are multiple ways to generate a project file using CMake depending on your platform and desired IDE, but here is an example for Linux: CD to the elements library.

If successful, cmake will generate a project file or makefiles in the build directory. Build the library and example programs using the generated makefiles or open the project file using your IDE and build all. You should see a couple of example applications in there that you can run. These examples are provided as starting points to get you up to speed in learning how to use the library. For simplicity, each example is contained in a single main.cpp source file. Feel free to inspect and mess with the examples. Each example demonstrates different aspects of the Elements library, from layout to control. You’d probably want to start with the “hello_universe” example, which is the Element’s hello-world counterpart. You can copy the “empty” example and use it as a boilerplate for your own project. See next section on how to copy an example and build outside the Elements project directory. Tips: Resize the window and see the elements fluidly resize Use two-finger swipe to move the sliders and knobs The Elements project is set up so that you can easily copy and paste any of the examples outside the project, set -DELEMENTS_ROOT=\"path/to/elements\", and the example should immediately build without any hassle.

Toggle buttons Buttons that alternate their state with each press. They are used to switch between two states. Latching buttons Buttons are buttons that stay on until programmatically reset. These classes delegate the rendering to a button styler subject. This separation of responsibilities provides greater flexibility in defining the button’s appearance and behavior.

Buttons include an on_click callable object, which is called whenever the button is clicked. btn A Button instance. f A callback function with the signature void(bool state). btn.on_click = f; The type of the on_click callable object is: std::function API. receiver is mixin class that provides a common interface for setting and querying the values of type T via virtual member functions, value() and value(val). btn A Button instance. val A boolean value. btn.value(val) (1) btn.vauel() (2) 1 Sets the value of the button to val. 2 Returns the current value of the button. This section is an advanced topic only relevant to those who want to write custom buttons. This section may be skipped by most users. The button styler is a separate element that is responsible for rendering the button. The communication with the button styler is done via the receiver API. This API provides a means to update the button styler about changes in button’s state to allow the styler to adjust the visual representation accordingly. If the button styler is as a subclass of receiver API, it will receive a button_state when the button’s state changes: struct button_state { bool value : 1 = false; bool hilite : 1 = false; bool tracking : 1 = false; bool enabled : 1 = true; }; button_state is struct struct for maintaining and managing the state of a button. This structure captures the various states that a button can have: value: The button’s value; 0(off) or 1(on). hilite: True if the button is highlighted (when the mouse is hovering over the button). tracking: True if the mouse button being pressed. enabled: True if the button is enabled. The button styler is just an element and does not have to follow the receiver API. If that’s the case, then the button rendering will be static, and not adjust to state changes. This may still be useful in certain cases. Copyright (c) 2014-2024 Joel de Guzman. All rights reserved.

The elements are laid out in a single column, top to bottom, immediately next to each other with no intervening space. The elements are positioned vertically using the children’s natural limits. Vertical space is allocated using this algorithm: Space is allocated for each child element following the child’s natural minimum vertical limit. If the allocated space exceeds the sum of all children elements' minimum vertical limits, the extra space is given to each vertically resizable element (limits.min.y managed by the vertical tile element. vtile(e1,...eN) vtile(item1, item2, item3, item4) If the number of elements is not fixed, you can use an vtile_composite (see below). In addition to the semantics of Vertical Tiles, returns instance of Composite. Create a vertical tile with an indeterminate (dynamic) number of elements. c Instance of type vtile_composite The vtile_composite is essentially a std::vector that the client uses to manage the composite’s elements. The client is responsible for the lifetime of the container, c. You can use vtile_composite in the same way as a std::vector, such as using push_back to add a child element. Just remember that the items are element_ptr instances. vtile_composite c; c.push_back(share(child)); share turns an element object into an element_ptr held by the std::vector in vtile_composite. vtile_composite is itself also an element and while it has std::vector's interface, it can also be shared like any element, which allows you to build complex hierarchical structures.
